<p>I&rsquo;ve had a love/hate relation with VIM and Sublime over the past few months. I love the concept of flow-based editing i.e vim-fu, but I also love the ease and beauty of sublime text.</p>

<p>I was tired of switching between the two and figuring out which is better. So I did something <em>unexpected</em>. I installed <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I had tried Atom back in the beta days, and frankly it did not leave a remarkable experience on me. It was slow and clunky, which is why I decided to stick to the <em>top guns</em> of the time.</p>

<p>I got Atom v1.3.0 installed on by ubuntu-box and fired it up.</p>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/atom
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install atom

<h3 id="first-looks">First looks</h3>

<p>Damn was it beautiful. I knew it that very second, on the &lsquo;Welcome&rsquo; screen, that <strong>this</strong> is what I&rsquo;m going to be using from now.</p>

<p>A lot of people argue that aesthetics aren&rsquo;t relevant for a text-editor, after all we do use mono-spaced fonts, and I&rsquo;ve seen countless posts and discussions, usually started by vim/emac fans, revolving around this very fact. But I beg to differ. I stare <em>directly</em> into an editor for the better part of my day, it makes a huge difference if it is aesthetically pleasing or not.</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean aesthetics &gt; functionality, and that is one of the reasons I don&rsquo;t hate command line embedded editors.</p>

<h3 id="beautifying-it-further">Beautifying it further.</h3>

<p>With more than 10 built in themes and syntax options, you really don&rsquo;t need to do any more &lsquo;manual&rsquo; customization.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not going to happen. So here we go.</p>

<p>A built in package manager is a warm welcome with intuitive and easy ways to customize and install packages, as easy as <code>apm install atom-beautify</code>.</p>

<p>A quick look over the top packages on their <a href="https://atom.io/packages/list">package control site</a>, gave plenty of amazing packages which could be installed in less than a minute.</p>

<p>I decided to install these:</p>
$ sort apm-packages

atom-beautify
atom-terminal
autoclose-html
autocomplete-paths
autocomplete-python
file-icons
fonts
git-log
git-plus
highlight-selected
linter
linter-flake8
merge-conflicts
sublime-style-column-selection
vim-mode
zen

$ cat apm-packages | xargs apm install

<p>I&rsquo;d advise you against installing all those <em>before</em> reading what they do. You can however open their respective package pages using this simple command:</p>
awk '{print "https://atom.io/packages/"$1}' apm-packages | xargs google-chrome

<p>Changed my font to <strong>Inconsolata-G</strong> (my current code favourite) using the <code>fonts</code> package and I was ready to go.</p>

<h3 id="with-3-by-github">&lt; &gt; with &lt;3 by GitHub</h3>

<p>One would think that a text editor made by GitHub would have excellent Git integration. I wish that were true.</p>

<p>Yes, they have amazing gutter git-diff colors and several other options like viewing a list of new/modified files since the last commit. Also shows the number of insertion/deletions, branch etc in the status bar.</p>

<p>The <code>git-plus</code> package adds a lot of functionality like <em>add, push, pull, commit, unstage etc..</em> which should have been provided in the base installation by atom. The package itself lacks polish and is rather unintuitive to use.</p>

<p>I constantly found myself switching back to the terminal to interface with Git (<code>atom-terminal</code> makes this extremely easy).</p>

<p>Also, GitHub has been strongly in support of Markdown yet I find almost non-existant markdown based features available, except for backtick on-the-fly syntax highlighting and live preview.</p>

<p>It has also managed to freeze my complete OS (Ubuntu 14.04) twice when using the <code>zen</code> package written by <em>Chris Wanstrath</em>, co-founder of GitHub, for distraction free writing (which should have been a feature of the stock editor). I haven&rsquo;t been able to pinpoint or reproduce the issue, but I hope it does not persist.</p>

<p>Apart from this, and a couple of hiccups like no inbuilt block selections, I&rsquo;m really liking <strong>Atom</strong> so far.</p>
