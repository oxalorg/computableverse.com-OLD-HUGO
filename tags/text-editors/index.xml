      <title>Atom: Love at first sight</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a love/hate relation with VIM and Sublime over the past few months. I love the concept of flow-based editing i.e vim-fu, but I also love the ease and beauty of sublime text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was tired of switching between the two and figuring out which is better. So I did something &lt;em&gt;unexpected&lt;/em&gt;. I installed &lt;a href=&#34;https://atom.io&#34;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had tried Atom back in the beta days, and frankly it did not leave a remarkable experience on me. It was slow and clunky, which is why I decided to stick to the &lt;em&gt;top guns&lt;/em&gt; of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got Atom v1.3.0 installed on by ubuntu-box and fired it up.&lt;/p&gt;
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/atom
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install atom

&lt;h3 id=&#34;first-looks&#34;&gt;First looks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damn was it beautiful. I knew it that very second, on the &amp;lsquo;Welcome&amp;rsquo; screen, that &lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt; is what I&amp;rsquo;m going to be using from now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people argue that aesthetics aren&amp;rsquo;t relevant for a text-editor, after all we do use mono-spaced fonts, and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen countless posts and discussions, usually started by vim/emac fans, revolving around this very fact. But I beg to differ. I stare &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; into an editor for the better part of my day, it makes a huge difference if it is aesthetically pleasing or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean aesthetics &amp;gt; functionality, and that is one of the reasons I don&amp;rsquo;t hate command line embedded editors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;beautifying-it-further&#34;&gt;Beautifying it further.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more than 10 built in themes and syntax options, you really don&amp;rsquo;t need to do any more &amp;lsquo;manual&amp;rsquo; customization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s not going to happen. So here we go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A built in package manager is a warm welcome with intuitive and easy ways to customize and install packages, as easy as &lt;code&gt;apm install atom-beautify&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick look over the top packages on their &lt;a href=&#34;https://atom.io/packages/list&#34;&gt;package control site&lt;/a&gt;, gave plenty of amazing packages which could be installed in less than a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to install these:&lt;/p&gt;
$ sort apm-packages

atom-beautify
atom-terminal
autoclose-html
autocomplete-paths
autocomplete-python
file-icons
fonts
git-log
git-plus
highlight-selected
linter
linter-flake8
merge-conflicts
sublime-style-column-selection
vim-mode
zen

$ cat apm-packages | xargs apm install

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d advise you against installing all those &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; reading what they do. You can however open their respective package pages using this simple command:&lt;/p&gt;
awk &#39;{print &#34;https://atom.io/packages/&#34;$1}&#39; apm-packages | xargs google-chrome

&lt;p&gt;Changed my font to &lt;strong&gt;Inconsolata-G&lt;/strong&gt; (my current code favourite) using the &lt;code&gt;fonts&lt;/code&gt; package and I was ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;with-3-by-github&#34;&gt;&amp;lt; &amp;gt; with &amp;lt;3 by GitHub&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would think that a text editor made by GitHub would have excellent Git integration. I wish that were true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, they have amazing gutter git-diff colors and several other options like viewing a list of new/modified files since the last commit. Also shows the number of insertion/deletions, branch etc in the status bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;git-plus&lt;/code&gt; package adds a lot of functionality like &lt;em&gt;add, push, pull, commit, unstage etc..&lt;/em&gt; which should have been provided in the base installation by atom. The package itself lacks polish and is rather unintuitive to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I constantly found myself switching back to the terminal to interface with Git (&lt;code&gt;atom-terminal&lt;/code&gt; makes this extremely easy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, GitHub has been strongly in support of Markdown yet I find almost non-existant markdown based features available, except for backtick on-the-fly syntax highlighting and live preview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has also managed to freeze my complete OS (Ubuntu 14.04) twice when using the &lt;code&gt;zen&lt;/code&gt; package written by &lt;em&gt;Chris Wanstrath&lt;/em&gt;, co-founder of GitHub, for distraction free writing (which should have been a feature of the stock editor). I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to pinpoint or reproduce the issue, but I hope it does not persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from this, and a couple of hiccups like no inbuilt block selections, I&amp;rsquo;m really liking &lt;strong&gt;Atom&lt;/strong&gt; so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
